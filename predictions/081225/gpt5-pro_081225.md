Here’s my best, honest stab at SPY today (times in ET). First, where we are right now:

## Stock market information for SPDR S\&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY)

* SPDR S\&P 500 ETF Trust is a fund in the USA market.
* The price is 635.92 USD currently with a change of -1.40 USD (-0.00%) from the previous close.
* The latest trade time is Tuesday, August 12, 05:21:04 PDT.

Quick context: the July CPI hit at 8:30 a.m. ET with headline +0.2% m/m and +2.7% y/y (a touch cooler than consensus), while core printed +0.3% m/m and +3.1% y/y (a hair hotter). That’s a mixed-but-not-scary read, so I’m leaning slightly positive vs. yesterday’s close of **635.92** as an anchor. ([Bureau of Labor Statistics][1], [SSGA][2])

# My price path for today (ET)

* **8:30 a.m.** → **\$639.10**
  1‑σ band: **\$634.10–\$644.10** (brief CPI knee‑jerk, then settle). ([Bureau of Labor Statistics][1])
* **12:00 p.m.** → **\$638.40**
  Band: **\$635.40–\$641.40** (post‑open digestion; watch for **Fed’s Barkin** around midday). ([Trading Economics][3])
* **2:00 p.m.** → **\$639.10**
  Band: **\$635.60–\$642.60** (pre–last-hour chop).
* **Close (4:00 p.m.)** → **\$638.46**
  1‑σ close band: **\$633.54–\$643.39**.

# Why these numbers (the “think very hard” part)

* **Anchor:** I’m starting from yesterday’s close **\$635.92** (official SPDR data). ([SSGA][2])
* **Catalyst read:** Headline CPI cooled to **2.7%** y/y (friendly), but **core at 3.1%** keeps the Fed from declaring victory. That usually tilts to **small up / range‑day**, not a trend day—unless rates make a big move. ([Bureau of Labor Statistics][1])
* **Volatility yardstick:** Recent SPY option IV (\~**12.3%** last week) implies a **\~0.77% daily σ**, i.e., about **±4.9 points** around fair value; I widened the 8:30 band to \~±5 given CPI spikes. ([OptionCharts][4])
* **Rates toggle:** If the 10‑year yield stays near **\~4.27%** or drifts lower, dips likely get bought; a push meaningfully above that risks a fade. ([FRED][5])

# What could bust this

* **Rates lurch** after the data (or a surprise Fed headline).
* **Midday Fed talk:** Richmond Fed’s Barkin can nudge expectations around noon. ([Trading Economics][3])

If you meant **Central Time**, shift those checkpoints one hour earlier (8:30 ET → **7:30 CT**, etc.). Want me to translate these into **entry/hedge levels** (supports/resistances) off the CPI ranges?
