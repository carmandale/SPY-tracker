### Reasoning
These predictions are based on verifiable current market data as of early August 12, 2025, including S&P 500 close at 6,373.45 on August 11 (implying SPY ~$637.35), pre-market trading near 6,387 (implying SPY ~$638.70), and E-Mini S&P 500 futures at $6,398.50 (up 0.4% from cash close). Key influences include upcoming U.S. CPI data release at 8:30 AM ET, which often drives volatility; analysis indicates choppy gains with resistance at 6,392, support at 6,383, and potential high of 6,425. Assuming CPI meets or beats expectations (consensus ~3.2% YoY), expect mild upward movement from pre-market levels, peaking mid-afternoon before slight end-of-day pullback. Daily volatility (~0.8% based on implied IV of 12.8%) supports ~$2-3 intraday swings. Note: Short-term stock predictions are inherently uncertain, driven by news and sentiment; these are estimates, not guarantees.
