# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Postgres Migration (Dev+Prod), Seed Production Data, and Verify 8am Job
> Created: 2025-08-16
> GitHub Issue: #13
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Migrate SPY TA Tracker from SQLite to PostgreSQL for both development and production environments, implement data migration strategy to preserve existing predictions and price history, and verify the critical 8am AI prediction scheduler job functions correctly with the new database.

## User Stories

### Production Reliability Story

As a daily SPY trader, I want the application to use a production-grade database so that my historical predictions and performance data are reliably stored and accessible without risk of data corruption or loss during high-traffic periods.

The trader has been using the app daily to track predictions and relies on historical accuracy metrics for calibration. Moving to PostgreSQL ensures data integrity during concurrent access and provides better performance for aggregating 20-day rolling metrics.

### Development Environment Story

As a developer working on the SPY TA Tracker, I want consistent PostgreSQL environments across development and production so that I can test database-specific features, performance characteristics, and migration scripts without environment-specific bugs.

The development workflow should mirror production database behavior, allowing for reliable testing of complex queries, transaction handling, and scheduled job performance.

### Scheduled Job Reliability Story

As the system administrator, I want to verify that the critical 8am CST scheduler job (AI predictions + price capture) works correctly with PostgreSQL so that daily predictions are generated reliably for traders who depend on morning market analysis.

The 8am job is the most critical system component - it generates AI predictions, captures pre-market prices, and locks the day's prediction data. Any failure here disrupts the entire user workflow.

## Spec Scope

1. **Development Environment PostgreSQL Setup** - Configure local development to use PostgreSQL with proper connection pooling and environment management
2. **Production PostgreSQL Configuration** - Set up production-ready Postgres with appropriate security, performance tuning, and backup strategies  
3. **Data Migration Strategy** - Migrate existing SQLite data (predictions, price logs, AI predictions) to PostgreSQL without data loss
4. **Schema Optimization** - Implement PostgreSQL-specific optimizations including proper indexes, constraints, and data types
5. **Scheduler Job Verification** - Thoroughly test the 8am AI prediction + price capture job against PostgreSQL to ensure reliability

## Out of Scope

- Migration to other database systems (MySQL, Oracle, etc.)
- Real-time database replication or clustering
- Database backup/restore automation (documented but not automated)
- Performance monitoring dashboards (beyond basic connection health)
- Multi-tenant database architecture

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Development environment automatically uses PostgreSQL** with seamless `./start.sh` workflow that starts both database and application
2. **Production deployment configuration** with PostgreSQL connection strings, environment variables, and security settings documented
3. **All existing SQLite data successfully migrated** to PostgreSQL with zero data loss, verified through automated data integrity checks
4. **8am scheduler job runs successfully** against PostgreSQL, confirmed through multiple test executions and logging verification
5. **Updated tech stack documentation** reflecting PostgreSQL as the primary database system with SQLite noted as deprecated
