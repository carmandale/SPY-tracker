# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-16-postgres-migration-#13/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-16
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

### Database Configuration Requirements

- **PostgreSQL Version**: 16+ for optimal performance and modern features
- **Connection Pooling**: SQLAlchemy connection pool with max 20 connections for production
- **SSL Requirements**: SSL/TLS encryption for production connections, optional for development
- **Character Encoding**: UTF-8 for proper text field handling
- **Timezone**: All timestamps stored with timezone awareness (UTC storage, CST display)

### Environment Configuration Requirements

- **Development**: Local PostgreSQL on port 5433 (avoid conflicts with system Postgres)
- **Production**: External PostgreSQL service with proper authentication and SSL
- **Connection String Format**: `postgresql+psycopg2://user:pass@host:port/dbname`
- **Environment Variable**: `DATABASE_URL` as primary configuration method
- **Fallback Behavior**: Application should fail fast with clear error if database unavailable

### Data Migration Requirements

- **Zero Downtime**: Migration should preserve all existing data without loss
- **Data Integrity**: Automated verification of row counts and key data points after migration
- **Schema Preservation**: Exact table structure including indexes, constraints, and foreign keys
- **Data Types**: Proper mapping from SQLite types to PostgreSQL equivalents
- **Timestamp Handling**: Maintain timezone-aware timestamps during migration

### Performance Requirements

- **Query Performance**: All existing queries must perform at least as well as SQLite
- **Index Strategy**: Proper indexes on date columns, foreign keys, and frequently queried fields  
- **Connection Efficiency**: Connection pooling to handle concurrent requests
- **Memory Usage**: Reasonable memory usage for development environments
- **Startup Time**: Database connectivity check should complete within 5 seconds

## Approach Options

**Option A:** Docker-based PostgreSQL (Selected)
- Pros: Consistent across environments, easy setup, isolated from system
- Cons: Requires Docker, additional resource usage

**Option B:** System-installed PostgreSQL
- Pros: Native performance, no Docker overhead
- Cons: Platform-specific installation, potential version conflicts

**Option C:** Cloud-hosted PostgreSQL only (production)
- Pros: Managed service, automatic backups, scaling
- Cons: Development/production parity issues, network dependency for dev

**Rationale:** Docker-based approach provides the best balance of development convenience and production parity. The existing Docker setup in the project supports this seamlessly.

## External Dependencies

- **psycopg2-binary** - PostgreSQL adapter for Python (already in requirements.txt)
- **docker** - Container runtime for local PostgreSQL instance
- **docker-compose** - Container orchestration (compose file already exists)

**Justification:** 
- psycopg2-binary: Official PostgreSQL adapter, required for SQLAlchemy PostgreSQL support
- Docker/Docker Compose: Already used in project for development workflow, minimal additional overhead

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Development Environment Setup
1. Update startup scripts to automatically detect and start PostgreSQL via Docker
2. Modify database configuration to prefer PostgreSQL when available
3. Test all existing endpoints against PostgreSQL
4. Verify scheduler jobs function correctly

### Phase 2: Data Migration Implementation  
1. Create migration script to export SQLite data to SQL format
2. Import exported data into PostgreSQL with proper type mapping
3. Implement data integrity verification checks
4. Test migration process with production data copies

### Phase 3: Production Configuration
1. Document production PostgreSQL setup requirements
2. Update deployment configuration for various hosting platforms
3. Configure production environment variables and connection strings
4. Test production deployment process

### Phase 4: Documentation and Testing
1. Update technical stack documentation
2. Create migration runbook for future use
3. Comprehensive testing of scheduler jobs against PostgreSQL
4. Performance verification and optimization

## Security Considerations

### Development Security
- Default credentials acceptable for local development
- Database accessible only from localhost
- No sensitive data exposure in development environment

### Production Security  
- Strong passwords generated and stored securely
- SSL/TLS encryption required for all connections
- Database user with minimal required permissions
- Regular security updates for PostgreSQL version

## Rollback Strategy

### Development Rollback
- SQLite database preserved during migration
- Environment variable switch to revert to SQLite
- Docker container can be destroyed and recreated easily

### Production Rollback
- Full database backup before migration
- Documented rollback procedure
- Application configuration rollback capability
- Emergency contact plan for critical issues

## Monitoring and Verification

### Health Checks
- Database connection health endpoint
- Scheduler job execution status monitoring  
- Data integrity verification endpoints
- Performance metrics collection

### Success Metrics
- All historical data preserved (row count verification)
- 8am scheduler job executes successfully for 3 consecutive days
- API response times maintain or improve compared to SQLite
- Zero data corruption detected in verification checks
