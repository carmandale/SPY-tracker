## Test Scenarios

### Critical Path Testing

**Scenario 1: Fresh Installation with PostgreSQL**
```python
def test_fresh_postgres_installation():
    """Test complete setup from scratch with PostgreSQL"""
    # Given: Clean environment with no existing database
    # When: Application starts with PostgreSQL configuration
    # Then: Database tables created, scheduler started, API accessible
```

**Scenario 2: Migration from SQLite to PostgreSQL**
```python  
def test_sqlite_to_postgres_migration():
    """Test migration preserves all data correctly"""
    # Given: Existing SQLite database with historical data
    # When: Migration process executed
    # Then: All data present in PostgreSQL, verification checks pass
```

**Scenario 3: 8am Scheduler Job Execution**
```python
def test_8am_scheduler_with_postgres():
    """Test critical morning job against PostgreSQL"""
    # Given: PostgreSQL database with previous day's data
    # When: 8am scheduler job triggered
    # Then: AI predictions generated, price captured, data persisted
```

### Edge Case Testing

**Scenario 4: Database Connection Loss During Operation**
```python
def test_postgres_connection_loss_recovery():
    """Test application behavior when PostgreSQL becomes unavailable"""
    # Given: Running application with active PostgreSQL connection
    # When: Database connection lost (network/service failure)
    # Then: Graceful error handling, automatic reconnection when available
```

**Scenario 5: Migration with Concurrent Access**
```python
def test_migration_with_concurrent_users():
    """Test migration doesn't break active user sessions"""
    # Given: Active API requests during migration
    # When: Migration process running
    # Then: Existing requests complete, new requests queue properly
```

**Scenario 6: Large Dataset Migration Performance**
```python
def test_large_dataset_migration():
    """Test migration performance with realistic data volumes"""
    # Given: SQLite database with 6+ months of daily predictions
    # When: Migration executed
    # Then: Completes within reasonable time, memory usage acceptable
```

### Error Handling Testing

**Database Error Scenarios**
- PostgreSQL service unavailable at startup
- Invalid database credentials provided
- Database disk space exhaustion during migration
- Network timeout during large data operations
- Concurrent transaction conflicts

**Migration Error Scenarios**
- Partial migration failure (some tables migrated, others failed)
- Data corruption detected during verification
- PostgreSQL version incompatibility
- Insufficient database permissions
- Schema mismatch between SQLite export and PostgreSQL import

**Scheduler Error Scenarios**
- 8am job fails due to database connection issues
- Multiple scheduler instances attempting same operations
- Job execution timeout with large datasets
- Timezone configuration errors affecting job timing
- External API failures during scheduled operations
