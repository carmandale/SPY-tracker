# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Official Price Capture Fix
> Created: 2025-08-16
> GitHub Issue: #8
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Fix the critical bug where the scheduler captures current market prices instead of official Open/High/Low/Close prices from historical data, ensuring accurate prediction evaluation and performance metrics.

## User Stories

### Accurate Price Tracking

As a trader using the SPY TA Tracker, I want the system to record the actual market open, intraday, and close prices so that my prediction accuracy can be properly evaluated against real market movements.

When the scheduler runs at key times (8:30 AM for open, 12:00 PM for noon, etc.), it should capture the official price for that checkpoint rather than whatever the current market price happens to be when the job executes.

### Historical Data Integrity

As a user reviewing my historical predictions, I want confidence that the recorded prices represent the actual market prices at those specific times so that I can trust the range hit percentages and calibration metrics.

The system should distinguish between real-time prices for live tracking and official historical prices for performance evaluation.

## Spec Scope

1. **Fix get_official_price implementation** - Ensure the method properly fetches OHLC data from yfinance historical data
2. **Add validation and error handling** - Robust fallback mechanisms when official prices aren't available
3. **Create comprehensive tests** - Unit tests for price capture scenarios including market hours, holidays, and data failures
4. **Add data reconciliation endpoint** - Admin endpoint to refresh/fix existing incorrect historical data
5. **Implement logging and monitoring** - Track when official vs fallback prices are used

## Out of Scope

- Switching to different data providers (stick with yfinance for MVP)
- Real-time price streaming during market hours
- Complex options data integration

## Expected Deliverable

1. Official price capture working correctly for all checkpoints (open, noon, 2PM, close)
2. Test suite validating price capture accuracy across different market scenarios
3. Admin endpoint to refresh historical data with correct official prices
4. Logging system to monitor price capture quality and failures
