## Pitch

SPY TA Tracker is a mobile-first options trading assistant that helps experienced traders track their SPY predictions and receive data-driven iron condor/butterfly suggestions by providing real-time tracking, performance metrics, and calibrated recommendations for 0DTE, weekly, and monthly options strategies.

## Users

### Primary Customers

- **Individual Options Traders**: Experienced traders who actively trade SPY options and want to systematically track their technical analysis predictions
- **Self-directed Investors**: Traders who prefer data-driven decision aids over automated trading systems

### User Personas

**Experienced Options Trader** (35-55 years old)
- **Role:** Active options trader, potentially full-time
- **Context:** Trades SPY options daily, uses technical analysis for predictions
- **Pain Points:** Manual tracking is tedious, hard to calibrate predictions over time, difficult to quickly determine optimal option structures
- **Goals:** Improve prediction accuracy, optimize option strategy selection, track performance metrics

## The Problem

### Manual Prediction Tracking

Options traders make daily predictions but rarely track them systematically, missing opportunities to improve their accuracy over time. Without historical data, traders can't calibrate their technical analysis or identify patterns in their prediction errors.

**Our Solution:** Automated tracking of predictions vs. actual outcomes with performance metrics.

### Option Structure Selection

Choosing between iron condors and iron butterflies requires quick analysis of market conditions, volatility, and directional bias. Traders often use suboptimal structures or miss profitable setups due to time constraints.

**Our Solution:** Automated suggestions for IC/IB structures based on predictions, bias, and historical accuracy.

### Morning Ritual Efficiency

Pre-market preparation is critical but time-constrained, requiring quick technical analysis, level identification, and strategy planning. Current tools are fragmented across multiple platforms.

**Our Solution:** Sub-60 second morning entry workflow optimized for mobile.

## Differentiators

### Mobile-First Design

Unlike traditional trading platforms that require desktop access, we provide a mobile-optimized experience designed for one-handed use during morning commutes or quick market checks. This results in consistent daily usage and better prediction tracking.

### Self-Calibrating Suggestions

Unlike static option calculators, our system learns from your prediction accuracy over time and adjusts recommendations accordingly. This results in increasingly personalized and accurate trade suggestions.

### Focused Simplicity

Unlike complex trading platforms with hundreds of features, we focus exclusively on SPY prediction tracking and option structure suggestions. This results in a streamlined workflow that takes seconds, not minutes.
