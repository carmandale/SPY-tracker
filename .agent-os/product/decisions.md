## 2025-08-11: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Development Team

### Decision

Build SPY TA Tracker as a personal trading tool initially, with potential for commercialization if it proves valuable. Focus on MVP functionality: morning predictions, automated price tracking, and next-day performance review.

### Context

The product addresses a clear need for systematic prediction tracking in options trading. Starting as a personal tool allows for rapid iteration and real-world validation before considering broader distribution.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Full-featured trading platform**
   - Pros: More comprehensive, potential for larger market
   - Cons: Complex, time-consuming, many competitors

2. **Simple spreadsheet tracker**
   - Pros: Quick to build, familiar interface
   - Cons: Limited mobile experience, no automation

### Rationale

Mobile-first web app provides the best balance of rapid development, easy access during market hours, and potential for enhancement without platform restrictions.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Fast MVP delivery
- Real trading validation
- Clear upgrade path

**Negative:**
- Limited initial features
- Single-user architecture may need refactoring for multi-user

## 2025-08-11: Package Manager Exception

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Development Team

### Decision

Use yarn as the JavaScript package manager for this project, despite organizational standard of npm.

### Context

Project was initialized with yarn, and yarn.lock file already exists with resolved dependencies. Switching would require dependency re-resolution without clear benefits.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Migrate to npm**
   - Pros: Aligns with org standards
   - Cons: Unnecessary work, risk of dependency issues

2. **Keep yarn**
   - Pros: No migration needed, faster installs
   - Cons: Diverges from org standard

### Rationale

Yarn provides faster, more reliable dependency management for this project. The deviation from organizational standards is documented and justified.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- No migration overhead
- Faster dependency installation
- Deterministic builds with yarn.lock

**Negative:**
- Team members need yarn installed
- Inconsistent with other projects using npm

## 2025-08-11: React 19 Adoption

**ID:** DEC-003
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Development Team

### Decision

Use React 19.0.0 (latest) instead of React 18 organizational standard.

### Context

Project already uses React 19, which includes performance improvements and new features. Organizational standard specifies "React 18+" which technically includes React 19.

### Rationale

React 19 provides better performance and developer experience. Since the standard specifies "18+", this exceeds rather than violates the standard.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Latest React features available
- Better performance out of the box
- Future-proof for longer

**Negative:**
- Potential compatibility issues with older libraries
- Less community documentation initially

## 2025-08-11: Testing Framework Selection

**ID:** DEC-004
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Development Team

### Decision

Implement Vitest for frontend, pytest for backend, and Playwright for E2E testing when testing phase begins.

### Context

Testing frameworks need to be compatible with the project's build tools (Vite for frontend, Python for backend).

### Rationale

- Vitest: Native Vite integration, fast execution
- pytest: Python standard, extensive ecosystem
- Playwright: Modern, reliable cross-browser testing

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Optimal framework choices for each layer
- Fast test execution
- Good documentation and community support

**Negative:**
- Three different testing frameworks to maintain
- Learning curve for team members unfamiliar with these tools
